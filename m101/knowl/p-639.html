<p>As you can see there is a big difference between having a zero slope and having no slope or undefined slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The first slope is not steep at all, in fact it is flat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The second slope can't get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large enough to express how steep it is. This is an undefined slope.</p>
