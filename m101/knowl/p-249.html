<p>Due to the fact that \(LHS\neq RHS\text{,}\) this demonstrates that \(3\) is not the solution. However, depending on the complexity of the problem, this "guess and check" method is not very efficient. Thus, we take a more algebraic approach to solving equations. First we will focus on what are called "one-step equations" or equations that only require one step to solve. While these equations often seem very fundamental, it is important to master the pattern for solving these problems so we can solve more complex problems.</p>
