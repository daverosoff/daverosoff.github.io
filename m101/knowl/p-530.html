<p>The plus or minus sign is also used to indicate an interval or range of values.  For example, you may have seen reports based on opinion polls where the percentage of the population in favor of a particular idea is estimated.  This estimate is usually given in the form: \(45 \pm 3\) percent.  Here, it means that the percentage of people in favor of the idea could range any where from \(42\%\) to \(48\%\text{.}\) It's the interval \([42, 48]\) where the ends of the interval are calculated by \(42=45-3\) and \(48=45+3.\) In this case, the \(\pm\) symbol represents a range of values, not just two numbers as in the previous example.</p>
