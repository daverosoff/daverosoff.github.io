<p><b class="terminology">Conditional probabilities</b> are probabilities calculated after information is given. This is where you want to find the probability of event \(A\) happening after you know that event \(B\) has happened. If you know that \(B\) has happened, then you don't need to consider the rest of the sample space. You only need the outcomes that make up event \(B\text{.}\) Event \(B\) becomes the new sample space, which is called the restricted sample space, \(R\text{.}\) If you always write a restricted sample space when doing conditional probabilities and use this as your sample space, you will have no trouble with conditional probabilities. The notation for conditional probabilities is \(P(A, \text{ given } B) = P(A|B)\text{.}\) The event following the vertical line is always the restricted sample space.</p>
