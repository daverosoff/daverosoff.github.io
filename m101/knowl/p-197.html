<p>Scientific notation is used to represent really large or really small numbers. The distance that light travels in a year in miles is a really large number. The mass of a single hydrogen atom in grams is a really small number. Doing basic operations such as multiplication and division with these numbers would normally be very cumbersome. However, our exponent properties make this process much simpler.</p>
