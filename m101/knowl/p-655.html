<p>We have used a table of values to graph a line. However, if we can identify some properties of the line, we can make a graph much more quickly. One such method uses the </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>slope (represented by \(m\)) and the</li>
<li>\(y\)-intercept (represented by \(b\))</li>
</ul>
<p>of the equation. Recall that the \(y\)-intercept is the point where the line crosses the vertical axis and that \(x = 0\) at this point.  Thus the \(y\)-intercept is the point \((0, b)\) where the graph crosses the vertical \(y\)-axis. Recall that any other point on the line can be represented by \((x, y)\text{.}\) Using this information we will look at the slope formula and solve the formula for \(y\text{.}\)</p>
