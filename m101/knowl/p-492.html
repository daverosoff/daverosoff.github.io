<p>Formulas may involve quite a few variables and sometimes quantities represented in a formula might be related. For example, you have two times to keep track of or three lengths.  In these cases, using the same letter for each variable makes it easier to remember what the variable represent.  To keep track of these "same named" quantities, we use <b class="terminology">subscripts</b> on the variables.  A subscript is a number or letter which is attached to the variable at the lower left of the variable like \(C_t\) or \(C_d.\) In this case, \(C_t\) might represent the cost of a tablet computer and \(C_d\) might be the cost of a desktop computer. Both might occur in a formula.</p>
