<p>Understanding probabilities are important in life. Examples of mundane questions that probability can answer for you are if you need to carry an umbrella or wear a heavy coat on a given day. More important questions that probability can help with are your chances that the car you are buying will need more maintenance, your chances of winning the lottery or your chances of being in a car accident. The chance of you winning the lottery is very small, yet many people will spend the money on lottery tickets. Yet, if instead they saved the money that they spend on the lottery, they would have more money. In general, events that have a low probability (under \(5\%\)) are unlikely to occur. Whereas, if an event has a high probability of happening (over \(80\%\)), then there is a good chance that the event will happen. This section will present some of the theory that you need to help make a determination of whether an event is likely to happen or not.</p>
