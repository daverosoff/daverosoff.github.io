<p>One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as 25, is very steep. A line with a small slope, such as \(\frac{1}{10}\) is very flat. We will also use slope to describe the direction of the line. A line that rises from left to right has a positive slope, and a line that falls from left to right has a negative slope. A horizontal line has zero slope. To measure steepness we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to how far the line runs. For this reason we will describe slope as the fraction \(\dfrac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}\text{.}\)</p>
