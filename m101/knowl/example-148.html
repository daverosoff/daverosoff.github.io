<p>When Paul was hired from his internship to a full time position, he was given a \(130\%\) salary increase. If his new salary is \(\$4,000\) per month, what was his old monthly internship pay?</p>
<p></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>Let \(p=\) the <b class="terminology">unknown</b> monthly internship pay</li></ul>
\begin{align*}
1.30\amp\amp\amp\text{The decimal equivalent of \(130\%\)}\\
1.30\cdot p \amp\amp\amp 130\%\text{ of his old pay (the salary increase)}\\
p + 1.30 p \amp\amp\amp \text{Add the increase to his old pay for his new salary}\\
p + 1.30 p\amp =4000 \amp\amp \text{Set up the equation: both sides represent the new salary}\\
2.30 p\amp =4000 \amp\amp \text{Combine like terms on the LHS, remember, \(p = 1p\)}\\
2.30 p\amp =4000 \amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by \(2.30\)}\\
p\amp= \dfrac{4000}{2.30} \amp\amp \text{Simplify}\\
p\amp= 1739.1304 \amp\amp \text{Our answer must be in terms of dollars and cents}\\
\text{Paul's internship pay was } \amp \$1,739.13 \amp\amp \text{Our Solution}\checkmark
