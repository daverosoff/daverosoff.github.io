\begin{align*}
\text{Start with the true statement }5\amp\gt 1 \amp\amp \text{Add \(3\) to both sides}\\
\text{We now have }8\amp\gt 4 \amp\amp \text{This is still true.  Now subtract \(2\) from both sides}\\
\text{We now have }6\amp\gt 2 \amp\amp \text{This is still true.  Next multiply both sides by \(3\)}\\
\text{We now have }18\amp\gt 6 \amp\amp \text{This is still true.  Now divide both sides by \(2\)}\\
\text{We now have }9\amp\gt 3 \amp\amp \text{This is still true.  Next add \(-1\) to both sides}\\
\text{We now have }8\amp\gt 2 \amp\amp \text{This is still true.  Next multiply both sides by \(-1\)}\\
\text{We now have }-8\amp\color{red}{\lt}\color{black}{}-2 \amp\amp \text{Notice the inequality sign changed direction}\\
\amp\amp\amp\text{to keep this true!}
\end{align*}
<p>Why did the inequality sign change direction when we multiplied by \(-1\text{?}\)  Let's rewrite this expression using subtraction instead of multiplication. Start again with \(8\gt 2\text{.}\) Subtract \(8\) then \(2\) from both sides, but don't simplify:</p>
\begin{align*}
8\amp\gt 2\\
\overline{-8}\amp \overline{\phantom{1}-8}\\
0\amp\gt 2-8\\
\overline{-2}\amp \overline{\phantom{1}-2}\\
-2\amp \gt -8
\end{align*}
<p>Note the inequality opens up towards the \(-2\text{.}\) Rewriting the order, we have</p>
\begin{gather*}
-8 \lt -2
\end{gather*}
<p>We have the two inequalities:</p>
\begin{align*}
8\amp\gt 2\\
-8\amp\lt -2
\end{align*}
<p>The second is the first multiplied by \(-1\text{.}\) Thus, multiplying by a negative changes the direction of the inequality sign.</p>
\begin{align*}
\text{Continue with }-8\amp\lt -2 \amp\amp \text{Now divide both sides by \(-2\)}\\
\text{We now have }4\amp\color{red}{\gt}\color{black}{}1 \amp\amp \text{Notice the inequality sign changed direction}\\
\amp\amp\amp\text{again to keep this true!}
\end{align*}
