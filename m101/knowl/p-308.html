<p>Notice here the \(x\) is on both the left and right sides of the equation. This can make it difficult to decide which side to work with. We fix this by adding or subtracting one of the terms with \(x\) to the other side, much like we do with a constant term. It doesn't matter which term gets added or subtracted, \(4x\) or \(2x\text{,}\) however, it would be our suggestion to subtract the smaller term in this case (to avoid negative coefficients). For this reason we begin this problem by  subtracting \(2x\) from both sides.</p>
