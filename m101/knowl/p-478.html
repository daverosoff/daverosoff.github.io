<p>Solving formulas is much like solving general linear equations. The only difference is we will have several variables in the problem and we will be attempting to solve for one specific variable. For example, we may have a formula such as \(A=\pi r^2 + \pi r s\) (formula for surface area of a right circular cone) and we may be interested in solving for the variable \(s\text{.}\) This means we want to isolate the \(s\) so the equation has \(s\) on one side, and everything else on the other. So a solution might look like \(s = \dfrac{A-\pi r^2}{\pi r}\text{.}\) This second equation gives the same information as the first which means they are algebraically equivalent. However, one is solved for the area \(A\text{,}\) while the other is solved for \(s\) (slant height of the cone).  In this section we will discuss how we can move from the first equation to the second.</p>
