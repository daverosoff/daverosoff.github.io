<p>If you look at the results of <a knowl="./knowl/example-conditional-cards.html" knowl-id="xref-example-conditional-cards" alt="Example 4.C.8 Conditional Probability--Cards" title="Example 4.C.8 Conditional Probability--Cards">Example 4.C.8</a>, notice that you get \(P(Spade|\text{the card is a }Jack)=\dfrac{1}{4}\) which is exactly the same as \(P(Spade)=\dfrac{13}{52}\) since there are \(13\) total spades in the entire deck. This means that knowing that the card is a Jack did not change the probability that the card is a Spade. This added knowledge did not help you in any way. It is as if that information was not given at all. However, if you compare the conditional probability of <a knowl="./knowl/example-card-probabilities.html" knowl-id="xref-example-card-probabilities" alt="Example 4.C.4 Probability--Select One Card" title="Example 4.C.4 Probability--Select One Card">Example 4.C.4</a> \(P(D=5|\text{the first die is a }2)=\dfrac{1}{6}\approx 16.67\%\) with \(P(D=5)=\dfrac{n(D=5)}{36}=\dfrac{4}{36}\approx 11.11\%\text{,}\) you will notice that they are not the same answer. In this case, knowing that the first die is a \(2\) did change the probability of getting a sum of \(5\text{.}\) In the first case, the events \(Spade\) and \(\text{the card is a }Jack\) are called <b class="terminology">independent events</b>. In the second case, the events sum of \(5\) and first die is a \(2\) are called <b class="terminology">dependent events</b>.</p>
