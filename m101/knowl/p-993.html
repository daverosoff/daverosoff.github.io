<p>Suppose you want to figure out if you should buy a new car. When you first go and look, you find two cars that you like the most. In your mind they are equal, and so each has a \(50\%\) chance that you will pick it. Then you start to look at the reviews of the cars and realize that the first car has had \(40\%\) of them needing to be repaired in the first year, while the second car only has \(10\%\) of the cars needing to be repaired in the first year. You could use this information to help you decide which car you want to actually purchase. Both cars no longer have a \(50\%\) chance of being the car you choose. You could actually calculate the probability you will buy each car, which is a conditional probability. You probably wouldn't do this, but it gives you an example of what a conditional probability is.</p>
