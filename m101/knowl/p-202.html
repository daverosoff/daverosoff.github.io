<p>When scientific notation is used to represent small numbers, the format requires the number be rewritten as a "bigger" value: \(0.0021\) must be written as \(2.1 \times 10^b\text{.}\)  What should the value of the exponent, \(b,\) be? Note that the decimal was moved three places and we've changed the value to be bigger than the original number.  Here is where the exponent on the \(10\) comes to the rescue.  If we divide \(2.1\) by \(10\) three times, the result will be \(.0021\text{.}\)  Dividing by \(10\) is the same thing as multipying by \(\frac{1}{10}\) and negative exponents allow us to write the fraction as a power of 10: \(10^{-1} = \frac{1}{10}.\) To finish the conversion of \(0.0021\) to scientific notation: \(0.0021 = 2.1 \times 10^{-3}.\)</p>
