<p>The reason this is true in the case of the Jack and the Ace is that these two events cannot happen together. There is no overlap between the two events, and in fact the \(P(J \cap A) = 0\text{.}\) However, in the case of the Spade and Ace, they can happen together. There is overlap, mainly the ace of spades. The \(P(S \cap A) \neq 0\text{.}\)</p>
