<p>Lines with zero slope or no slope can make a problem seem very different. A horizontal line has slope of zero, which when multiplied by \(x\) gives zero in the equation. So the equation simply becomes \(y = b\) (the \(y\)-intercept of the graph). The equation of a vertical line can't be written in slope-intercept form at all because the slope is undefined. There is no \(y\) in these equations. We will simply make \(x\) equal to the \(x\)-intercept of the graph.</p>
