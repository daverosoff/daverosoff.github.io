<p>On Saturday, Brooks bought groceries and filled her gas tank.  She spent \(\$53\) on groceries, which was \(\$18\) less than twice what she spent on gasoline.  How much did Brooks spend on filling her tank with gas?</p>
<p>Since we don't know how much she spent on gasoline, we will use a variable to represent this unknown amount. Sometimes it is helpful to write out the other quantities described in the problem in terms of the variable.</p>
\begin{align*}
\text{Let \(d =\) dollars spent on gas} \amp\amp\amp \text{Translate the quantities into mathematical expressions}\\
2d\amp\amp\amp\text{Translation of }``\text{twice what she spent on gasoline"}\\
\text{\(2d-18 =\) cost of groceries} \amp\amp\amp \text{The groceries cost \(\$18\) }``\text{less than" twice the gas cost}\\
\text{\(\$53 =\) cost of groceries} \amp\amp\amp \text{We already know the cost of the groceries}\\
2d-18\amp = 53 \amp\amp \text{We have two equal expressions for cost of the groceries}
\end{align*}
<p>We have an equation that relates the unknown dollars spent on gas to the situation in the problem. Now, solve the equation.</p>
\begin{align*}
2d-18\amp = 53 \amp\amp \text{Solve the equation for\(x\)}\\
2d \amp = 71 \amp\amp \text{Added \(18\) to each side}\\
d \amp = 35.5 \amp\amp \text{Divided both sides by 2}\\
\text{She spent \(\$35.50\) on gas.} \amp\amp\amp \text{Our Solution}\checkmark
\end{align*}
