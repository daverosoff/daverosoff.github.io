<p>Note that the problems in WeBWorK will have different settings, but similar methods for setting up an equation to solve the problem. Also notice that we could have set up the equation for the past example as \(x + 0.085 x =532.45\) to start with if since it is equivalent to \(x = 532.45 - 0.085 x.\) As long as your equation describes a valid relationship from the problem, you will be able to use it to calculate the solution to the problem.</p>
