<p>The complement is useful when you are trying to find the probability of an event that involves the words <em class="emphasis">"at least"</em> or an event that involves the words <em class="emphasis">"at most"</em>. As an example of an at least event is suppose you want to find the probability of making <em class="emphasis"><b class="terminology">at least</b></em> \(\$50,000\) when you graduate from college. That means you want the probability of your salary being greater than or equal to \(\$50,000\text{.}\) An example of an at most event is suppose you want to find the probability of rolling a die and getting <em class="emphasis"><b class="terminology">at most</b></em>a \(4\text{.}\) That means that you want to get less than or equal to a \(4\) on the die. The reason to use the complement is that sometimes it is easier to find the probability of the complement and then subtract from \(1\text{.}\)</p>
